# CS-210-Investment-Calculator

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
This project created an investment calculator that computes the growth of savings over time with or without monthly deposits. It helps users visualize how different interest rates and contributions affect long-term financial outcomes.

What did you do particularly well?
I implemented clean, modular code by separating logic into distinct functions and classes, making the program easier to follow and test. The user interface and output formatting were also handled effectively for clarity.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could improve input validation and error handling to prevent invalid data entries and potential crashes. Adding these enhancements would make the program more user-friendly, robust, and secure.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was calculating compound interest accurately and managing data between classes. I overcame this by consulting C++ documentation, debugging iteratively, and using online forums to clarify logic errors.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming, modular design, and input/output handling â€” all of which apply to many programming and data-driven projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used descriptive variable names, consistent formatting, and thorough commenting to make the code easy to understand. The class-based structure also allows for future feature expansions without major rewrites.
